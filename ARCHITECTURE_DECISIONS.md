## ADR-001: Monorepo Architecture with Bun

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The application needed a clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared code while maintaining simplicity in dependency management and build processes.

### Decision
Implement a monorepo structure with three workspaces:
- `client/` - React frontend application
- `server/` - Hono backend API
- `shared/` - Common TypeScript types and utilities

Use Bun as the primary runtime and package manager for all workspaces.

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Simplified dependency management across all packages
- Type safety with shared types between client and server
- Single build and development workflow
- Fast builds and test execution with Bun

**Negative:**
- All packages must use the same Bun version
- Potential for cross-package coupling if not managed carefully

## ADR-002: Cloudflare Edge Infrastructure

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The application needed global distribution, low latency, and cost-effective serverless deployment options.

### Decision
Deploy the entire application on Cloudflare's edge infrastructure:
- Backend API on Cloudflare Workers
- Frontend on Cloudflare Pages
- Data persistence using Cloudflare KV
- CI/CD through GitHub Actions with Wrangler

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Global edge distribution with low latency
- Cost-effective serverless scaling
- Integrated CDN and security features
- Simplified deployment pipeline

**Negative:**
- Vendor lock-in to Cloudflare ecosystem
- KV storage limitations (eventual consistency, size limits)
- Workers runtime limitations (CPU time, memory)

## ADR-003: OpenTelemetry with Honeycomb for Observability

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The application needed comprehensive observability for monitoring performance, debugging issues, and understanding user behavior in a distributed edge environment.

### Decision
Implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation throughout the backend API with:
- Custom spans for all API operations
- Structured event logging for business events
- Integration with Honeycomb for telemetry collection and analysis
- Environment-specific configuration for dev/production

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Real-time performance monitoring and alerting
- Detailed debugging information for distributed requests
- Business analytics through custom events
- Industry-standard observability practices

**Negative:**
- Additional complexity in request handling
- Potential performance overhead from instrumentation
- External dependency on Honeycomb service
- Additional configuration required for deployment

## ADR-004: Hono Web Framework for Backend API

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The backend needed a lightweight, fast web framework optimized for edge environments and Workers runtime.

### Decision
Use Hono web framework for the backend API with:
- TypeScript-first development
- Middleware support for CORS and telemetry
- Type-safe routing and request handling
- Optimized for Cloudflare Workers runtime

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Excellent performance in edge environments
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Minimal bundle size and cold start times
- Growing ecosystem and community support

**Negative:**
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Express.js
- Fewer third-party middleware options
- Potential learning curve for developers familiar with other frameworks

## ADR-005: React with TailwindCSS and Radix UI

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The frontend needed a modern, accessible UI framework with rapid development capabilities and consistent design patterns.

### Decision
Implement the frontend using:
- React 19 with TypeScript for component development
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Radix UI for accessible component primitives
- Vite for build tooling and development server

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Rapid UI development with utility classes
- Built-in accessibility with Radix components
- Consistent design system across the application
- Fast development builds with Vite

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with utility-first CSS
- Potential for large CSS bundle sizes if not optimized
- Additional abstraction layer with Radix components

## ADR-006: KV-Based Data Persistence

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The application needed simple data persistence for ballot and vote storage without the complexity of a traditional database.

### Decision
Use Cloudflare KV for data persistence with:
- JSON serialization for ballot and vote data
- Single "ballots" key containing all ballot data
- In-memory demo data fallback for new installations
- Environment-specific KV namespaces

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Simple data model matching application needs
- No database management overhead
- Integrated with Cloudflare infrastructure
- Global replication at edge locations

**Negative:**
- Eventual consistency model may cause data conflicts
- Size limitations on stored values
- No complex querying capabilities
- Potential data loss if KV key becomes corrupted

## ADR-007: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The application needed automated testing and deployment to maintain code quality and enable rapid iteration.

### Decision
Implement GitHub Actions workflow with:
- Automated testing on all pull requests
- Build validation for all workspaces
- Automatic deployment to Cloudflare on main branch merges
- Environment variable and secret management through GitHub

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Consistent build and deployment process
- Automated quality gates before deployment
- Integration with GitHub development workflow
- Clear deployment status and history

**Negative:**
- Coupling to GitHub ecosystem
- Potential delays in deployment during GitHub outages
- Complexity in managing secrets across multiple services

## ADR-008: TypeScript Everywhere

**Date:** 2025-07-27
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** Development Team

### Context
The application needed type safety across all components to prevent runtime errors and improve developer experience.

### Decision
Use TypeScript for all code:
- Strict type checking enabled across all workspaces
- Shared type definitions in `shared/` package
- Type-safe API contracts between client and server
- Build-time type validation

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Reduced runtime errors through compile-time checking
- Better IDE support and developer experience
- Self-documenting API contracts
- Easier refactoring with type safety

**Negative:**
- Additional build complexity
- Longer initial development time for type definitions
- Potential over-engineering of simple data structures
